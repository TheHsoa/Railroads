Railroads
There is a famous railway station in Magzin City. Country there is incredibly hilly.
The station was built in last century. Unfortunately, funds were extremely limited
that time. It was possible to establish only a surface track. Moreover, it turned out
that the station could be only a dead-end one and due to lack of
available space it could have only one track.
